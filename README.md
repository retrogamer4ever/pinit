TODO
<br>
Due to the holidays did not have enough time to completely clean up the code, if had few more days would probably
have improved the images in mobile app, replaces all of the mobile icons, further abstracted some of the data in 
the classes and further streamlined a lot of the code. How some of the stuff is done in the activities and other
places could be optimized better and cleaned up better.
